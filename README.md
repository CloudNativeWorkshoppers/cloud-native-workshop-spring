# Action Items to achieve STL and Devoxx/UK workshops:

* Create slides for Cloud Native Application and Spring Boot intros (Jim)
* Create slides for intial exercise, and supply link to book example (Jim)
* Create golden examples of quote service and place in repository: (Mark)
 1. Simple quote service like intro_quote_service but with code split out into three classes
 2. Quote service example that uses H2

# cloud-native-workshop-spring
Workshop to demonstrate concepts and development of cloud native Java applications, 12(ish) factors, using Spring Boot and Cloud Foundry for toolchain/platform.

# Workshop Description
This workshop introduces students to concepts and development practices surrounding cloud-native Java applications.  Cloud-native applications are distributed systems built for running in the cloud, that embody characteristics essential for flourishing in their native habitat.  These characteristics include horizontal scalability of microservices, resiliency in spite of underlying operation failures, and agility in development and deployment.

This is designed to be a half to full day instructor led workshop (approximately 3 - 7 hours of seat time).  It should consist of about 20% instructor-led instruction/discussion and 80% hands-on activities (mostly software development) with the instructor available to help as needed.

# Required Resources
The required resources leveraged by this course are:
  * Long, J. & Bastani, K. (2016). Cloud Native Java: Designing Resilient Systems with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry. O’Reilly Media.  Here is a [link to the book in its current state] (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxMgihXh58_Ud1l5RTRQZXhrbFE), within Pivotal Google Drive. 
  * Pivotal Web Services account (available as a free trial).
  * Computer with Mac, Windows or Linux operating system capable of running Eclipse 4.5 and with at least 1 GB free storage for applications developed in this course.
  * Internet access to resources located on the web such as the Spring Guides referred to by the course.

# Workshop Modules

## Module 1: Developing a Spring Boot Application

### Module Objectives: 
By the end of the module, students will...
  1. assess whether their computers are capable of running the software required by the workshop.
  2. install Spring Tool Suite IDE on their machines successfully.
  3. install curl on their machines successfully if not already there (some operating systems include it).
  4. achieve a quick win by developing and running a “Hello World” style Spring Boot application.
  5. gain a basic understanding of Spring Boot, including its role in developing microservices.
  6. understand the purpose of Spring Boot starter projects
  7. be exposed to the Maven pom.xml file for their Spring Boot application

### Module Description: 
This module introduces students to the workshop and gives them a jump-start with Spring Boot development.  After the instructor welcomes the students and gives them an introduction to the workshop (using this document for reference), the instructor will give a brief explanation of cloud native applications and their advantages (using the Cloud Native Application chapter for reference).  The instructor will also give a high-level introduction of Spring Boot (using the Introducing Spring Boot chapter for reference).  The instructor will then introduce the in-class assignment instructions, which consists of the entire Getting Started with the Spring Tool Suite and Spring Boot Starters sections of the Introducing Spring Boot chapter.  The student will then work through the assignment with the instructor available when help is needed.
